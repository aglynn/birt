The BIRT Drupal module allows a BIRT design's HTML contents to be displayed as it's own content type in a Drupal website. It allows dynamic content from any data source to be displayed. As it's own Drupal content type, the title and BIRT design file can be set to include as many BIRT designs as needed. Anyone with the need to add dynamic, data-driven BIRT content to their open source Drupal content management system will find the BIRT module extremely valuable. BIRT is an open source Business Intelligence program with possibly the most free features of any BI application.

Drupal 7 version: Assuming you have your site's private file directory setup (at /admin/config/media/file-system), to get birt working you just install the module, go to /admin/config/birt and type where your BIRT server is located, where the birt directory of your Tomcat server is. Please note that in order for you to only have to store the BIRT design files on your Drupal site, your BIRT engine needs to be able to read remote design files, which can be done simply by changing the param-value to "all" for URL_REPORT_PATH_POLICY within [tomcat_directory]/webapps/birt/WEB-INF/web.xml. Please that this module works out of box when your BIRT report design files are pointing to online data sources as opposed to a flat file you have; if your report uses a local flat file as the data source then you will want to upload that flat file to your Drupal file system and then ensure your design file is pointing to it.

Drupal 6 version: It uses BIRT OS 2.5.2 and the PHP-Java Bridge v6.1.1 running in any J2EE implementation like Tomcat. The Drupal 6 module and its dependencies are available at http://www.birt-exchange.com/be/marketplace/app-showcase/?app=78. This site, BIRT Exchange, is where BIRT plugins are stored. In depth instructions for the Drupal 6 module is available at http://billbrantley.com/DBDemos/DBInstructions.html. The Drupal 6 version was originally created by Mohit Sehgal. The Drupal 5 and 6 versions of this module have been used successfully on live sites. The Drupal 7 version is a complete rewrite.
