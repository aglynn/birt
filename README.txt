The BIRT Drupal module allows a BIRT design's HTML contents to be displayed as it's own content type in a Drupal website. 

It allows dynamic content from any data source to be displayed. 

As it's own Drupal content type, the title and BIRT design file can be set to include as many BIRT designs as needed. 

Anyone with the need to add dynamic, data-driven BIRT content will want this module.

Drupal 7 version: 

You must have your site's private file directory setup (at /admin/config/media/file-system). 

To get birt working you just install the module, go to /admin/config/birt and enter the Tomcat BIRT server.
